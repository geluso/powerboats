    <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Powerboats! Powerboats is an fast, fun, competitive
      boat-racing board game made by Cwali. This is really one of the best
      racing-themed board games I've ever played, and I've played a lot! Keep
      reading to find out how this game works and hear about how there's more
      strategy to it than just rolling dice randomly.
    </p>

    <p>
      I highly recommend buying the physical board game. Unfortunately it is
      out of publication. Your best bet for obtaining a copy of the game is
      looking through third Party websites like E-bay or the Amazon market
      place.

    </ul>

    <h2 id="movement">Moving, Buoys, and Racing</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of the game is to race around each buoy and return to cross
      the finish line first. The buoys are labelled with numbers one through
      three. You must go around the buoys in that order.
    </p>

    <p>
      You must always move your boat in a straight line. You may face a
      different direction at the beginning of your turn. Once your boat
      starts moving you may only move in that one direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your boat is allowed to move through spaces containing other boats, but
      you may not end your turn on the same space as another boat. If you end
      on the same space as another boat then move your boat backward until
      you are on a free space. Yes, if multiple boats are lined up you move
      back through multiple boats until landing on a free space. You do not
      take any damage passing through boats, or moving back through boats to
      end your turn on an open space.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your boat moves forward and hits land your boat complete stops and
      takes damage. Damage taken is equal to the number of spaces your boat
      still had left to move. Each point of damage fills a space in your dice
      bank and prohibits you from having more dice. If you had five spots
      open in your dice bank and took 2 damage your boat may now only have
      up to three dice. If taking damage leaves you with more dice than you
      have room to bank then you must remove dice (at your choosing) so you
      only have dice to your bank capacity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, your boat always travels in a straight line. For example: if you
      have three dice [1,2,2] totalling five then you boat must move in a
      straight line for the total of five spaces.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dice">Dice: Rolling, Rerolling, Removing</h2>

    <p>
      Each turn you may choose to manipulate only up to one dice. This means
      each turn you may do only one of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Manipulate zero dice and maintain your same speed.</li>
        <li>Roll in a new dice and add it to your bank.</li>
        <li>Choose any one dice from your dank and reroll it.</li>
        <li>Choose any one dice from your dank and remove it.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      After your choose what you want to do with your dice you choose if you
      want to change the direction your boat is facing. Your boat can only
      rotate left or right once per turn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your movement options after manipulating your dice and seeing your speed are:
      <ul>
        <li>Keep going straight in your current direction.</li>
        <li>Rotate left and go straight in that direction.</li>
        <li>Rotate right and go straight in that direction.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall your turn looks like this:

      <ul>
        <li>Manipulate up to one dice.</li>
        <li>Turn left, turn right or continue stright.</li>
        <li>Move forward in a straight line according to your speed.</li>
        <li>Take damage and discard dice as necessary.</li>
      </ul>

    </p>

    <h2 id="house-rules-power-turns">House Rules: Power-Turns</h2>

    <p>
      One house rule I love playing with we call "power turns." If you only
      have one dice in your bank (no matter if the value is one, two or
      three) then you are allowed to "power turn" and make two left or right
      rotations before moving straight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's a great thread on Board Game Geek with someone discussing their
      own variants. Link: <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1599066/formula-p">Formula P Variant</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="house-rules-two-players">House Rules: Two Players</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a great variant if you're just playing with two players and want
      to mitigate against the randomness of dice rolls. Unfortunately this
      variant isn't yet suited totally well for this implementation of the
      game online.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each player controls two boats, and both those boats share the same
      engine. The first player to get both of their boats across the finish
      line wins the race.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both of the boats share a dice bank. If you roll a two, then a three
      you can move your first boat forward two, then your second boat forward
      five. Or, you could move your first boat forward two, then move your
      first boat forward again five. You do not have to alternate which boat
      you move. You may move either boat during any turn. You may only move
      one boat per turn.
    </p>

    <p>
      This variant is a fun way to mitigate against random, unfavorable dice
      rolls. Since you're moving two boats it is likely that a roll that's
      bad for one boat might actually be good for another boat. It is fun to
      have a bit of an elastic leap frog game bringing your boats together to
      the finish line.
    </p>

    <h2 id="website-quirks">A Note About Quirks of this Website</h2>

    <p>
      This website is a hobby project. There's obviously no money being made.
      Uhh, if there are advertisements when you look at this webpage perhaps
      talk to your internet service provider because I guarantee I did not
      put those there.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll notice that this game does not really enforce turn-order, or
      prohibit players from rolling multiple dice, or turning as much as they
      want every turn.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's correct! This website and this multiplayer game engine do not
      really enforce rules of any kind. This website is built to allow people
      to play the game and have freedom while they play. It is up to players
      to choose and enforce their own rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why is this implementation like this? Well, for one it is sort of
      easier to create. For another, if anything ever goes wrong I believe in
      players having the ability to correct their mistakes. I've played too
      many online board games where weird things happen due to bugs,
      misunderstandings, or poor UI (looking at you Catan). I don't like the
      feeling of the program trapping you in to a mistake. I hope this style
      of gaming makes players feel empowered about the way they choose to play
      the game, and perhaps feel like they're really around a physical table.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, this project is ever-evolving and I absolutely seek to add
      things that make the game more playable and enjoyable. There is a turn
      indicator after all. It just doesn't yet account for other-than-five
      players, lol.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you and have fun.
