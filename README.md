# HTML5 Canvas Powerboats Boat Racing Board Game
This is an implementation of Powerboats, an old boat racing board game. The
game itself isn't published anymore. You'll need to buy it off Ebay or
somewhere if you want to get your own copy of it, which I highly recommend.

This is being ported from my own implementation of Catan, so if you see
any Catan code around, here's where it's coming from: <https://github.com/geluso/catan>

See the author's own website for more information about the board game:

Check the game out on Board Game Geek
